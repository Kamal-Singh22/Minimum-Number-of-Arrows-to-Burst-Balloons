# Minimum-Number-of-Arrows-to-Burst-Balloons
here are n balloons, each represented by a pair of coordinates start and end, which denote the horizontal diameter of the balloon.
Explanation:
Sort the balloons by the end of their range.

Start with the first balloon's end as the position to shoot the first arrow.

For each balloon, if its start is beyond the current arrow's position, we need a new arrow.
